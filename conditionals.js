replace the blank with a conditional statement so that the lunch invitation is only printed if isHungry is true. Change the boolean in the isHungry variable to check and see if your conditional statement works.

/* ==== EXERCISE 6: CHALLENGE ====
Write a conditional statement that mimics an automatic checkout machine at a store.

===== This example is pseudocode, but it describes what our challenge program should do! ======
if customerPayment is greater than the totalCheckoutCost, calculate the customer's change and print a statement like this:
        Your change is $3.25. Thank you for shopping with us today.
if customerPayment is less than the totalCheckoutCost, calculate the remaining balance and print a statement like this:
        There is still $2.75 remaining on your balance.
if customerPayment is equal to the totalCheckoutCost, print a statement wishing the customer a nice day.
        Thanks and have a nice day!
*/

// let customerPayment = _______
// let totalCheckoutCost = _______

write conditional statement below:
