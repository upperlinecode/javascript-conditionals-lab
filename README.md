## Intro

Conditionals are a super important tool in your toolbox, as they allow the programs you write to react dynamically to variable circumstances. This lab will help you to get more comfortable using if, else, and else-if statements along with examples of where the use of conditionals are necessary. 

## The Lab 

Open up the file named, `conditionals.js`, and follow the instructions written as comments throughout the file. As you go through the exercise one at a time, some of the pre-written code associated with each challenge is commented to avoid clogging up your output. Make sure to uncomment it first, and then when your code works as expected, comment it again and move on.
